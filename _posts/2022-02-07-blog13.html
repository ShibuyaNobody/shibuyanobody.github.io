        <h1>What is Angular?</h1>
        <p>Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source JavaScript framework. It's run by Google, and its major goal is to create single-page apps. Angular has evident advantages as a framework, and it also provides a common structure for developers to work with.</p>

        <p>Angular's attractive features, including as templating, two-way binding, modularization, RESTful API handling, dependency injection, and AJAX handling, aid in the development of interactive and dynamic single page applications (SPAs).</p>

        <h1>Why should you use Angular?</h1>
        <p>There are a number of reasons why you would want to use Angular. One of the biggest reasons you would want to use Angular is because it is supported by Google. Google offers its Long-Term Support (LTS) to Angular that sheds light on Google's plan to stick with the framework and further scale the Angular ecosystem. Another reason you would want to use Angular is because it uses a TypeScript language, which is a superscript for JavaScript. This is good because it ensures that you have a higher security as it helps catch and eliminate errors earliy in the process while writing the code of performing maintenance tasks.</p>
