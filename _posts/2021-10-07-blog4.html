        <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for a variety of purposes, including web development, web apps, game creation, and more. It enables you to add dynamic features to web sites that you couldn't achieve with only HTML and CSS. In way, that makes JavaScript the final piece of the puzzle when creating HTML pages.</p>

        <p>For accomplishing dynamic tasks on the web, several browsers employ JavaScript as a scripting language. You can notice the impacts of JavaScript when you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a website, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to mention a few things.</p>

        <h1>JavaScript's Dynamic Capabilities</h1>
        <p>The structure of your online document, as well as the content within it, is defined by HTML. CSS specifies different styles for the contents of a web document. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamic programming language that enables Math computations, dynamically adds HTML material to the DOM, makes dynamic style declarations, and retrieves content from another website, among other things.</p>
