        <h1>What is Full Stack?</h1>

        <img class="img" src="https://blog.eduonix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Full-Stack-Developer.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="auto">

        <p>Full stack technology refers to the complete depth of a computer system application, and full stack developers work in both the front end and the back end of the web development process. Everything a client, or site visitor, may see and interact with is on the front end. The back end, on the other hand, refers to all of the application's servers, databases, and other internal infrastructure; the end-user seldom interacts with this realm directly.</p>

        <p>Here are a couple things that you are able to do as a full stack developer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Program a browser by using either JavaScript, JQuery, Angular, or Vue</li>
            <li>Program a server by using either PHP, ASP, Python, or Node</li>
            <li>Program a database by using either SWL, SQlite, or MongoDB</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What are the advantages of being a full stack web developer?</h1>
        <p>When being a full stack web developer there are a lot of advantages to it, and here are a couple of them. One of the advantages you can get from being a full stack developer is that it allows you to makser all the techniques involved in development a development project. By matering all the techniques it gives you more control over your projects, and what you are able to perform. Another advantage to being a full stack developer is that you can easily make a prototype faster and provide help to all othe members working on the same project. You can also reduce the cost of the project, the time used for team communication, and switch between front and back end development since full stack falls in both categories.</p>

        <p>Although, with advantages, there is also its disadvantages. Sometimes, solutions can be wrong for a project, and sometimes that very same solution could only depend on a single developrs skills. The solution itself can also generate a key person risk, but at the same time being a full stack developer can become increasingly complex. Sometimes working as a full stack developer can cause complications because it is ineffective. You usually want to focus on one thing to be as effective as possible, so you would want to try and focus on either the back end or the front end. The more you focus on one area, the easier and more effective your work will become.</p>
